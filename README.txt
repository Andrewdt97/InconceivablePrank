Inconceivable!

It looks like you computer has been hacked by thieves from Guilder! In order to distract you from their crimes, they left 1,000 text files littered on your desktop and they seem to be… script excerpts from The Princess Bride. And worse than that, the files seem to be protected!

But I’ve heard a thing or two about Guilder cybercrimes and I might be able to give you a hand:
- In the midst of the 1,000 scripts of The Princess Bride, there should be one file containing the Guilder’s private RSA key.
- I’ve heard that if you put the RSA key into the privateKeyInput.txt file and then run ./decode that you can delete the files.
- Don’t delete any of the other files as they are vital to your success.

You’re up against a Sicillian with death on the line, but I trust you, comrade.
